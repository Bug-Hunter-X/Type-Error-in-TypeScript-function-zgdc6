# Type Error in TypeScript function
This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript that occurs when a function expecting a specific type receives an argument of a different type.
The `greeter` function expects a string argument, but the code passes an array of strings. This results in a type error.
The solution shows how to modify the code to correctly handle the array of strings.
